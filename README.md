# OpenCV Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress in learning OpenCV and serves as a base for my planned project.

## Goal
The ultimate goal of this learning process is to create a project that generates timestamps in videos whenever an object approaches a vehicle or a defined area of interest.

## Project Idea: Video Object Detection with Timestamp
The project will detect objects within a video feed and:
1. Identify when an object enters a predefined proximity to a car or selected area.
2. Generate a timestamp for each detection event.
3. Optionally highlight the detected object or area in the video.

## Learning Resources
- **Video Tutorial**: [Learn OpenCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLDJJXEykvo&t=536s)


## Planned Steps
1. **Basic OpenCV Learning**:
   - Understand video processing with OpenCV.
   - Learn object detection techniques (e.g., Haar cascades, HOG, or YOLO).
2. **Experimentation**:
   - Experiment with different algorithms for object detection.
   - Test with sample videos for detecting objects near a car.
3. **Project Implementation**:
   - Develop the detection logic.
   - Implement timestamp recording.
   - Integrate the system to overlay or log timestamps in the video.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- OpenCV
- Optional: Additional libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (if using advanced models).

## Progress Tracking
I will regularly update this repository with code snippets, progress notes, and findings.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate real-time video processing.
- Add distance measurement for detected objects.
- Explore deploying the system on edge devices like Raspberry Pi for in-car usage.
